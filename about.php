					<h1>The Company</h1>
					<div class="body">
					Technology can be incredible when implemented correctly, and we know how to implement.  Chiedo Labs was founded in 2012 by Chiedo John during his last semester at James Madison University and has been growing rapidly ever since.  We want to contribute to technology that has been set up the right way, with a focus on the web.  If you are looking for a team of coders to support your team or project, we are definitely the team for the job.  Currently we are based in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia but have clients nationwide and overseas.

					<h1>The Team</h1>
					<div class="body">
					Our team is made up of coders, problem solvers and people that have a solid understanding of technology.  We love what we do.  We are a younger company, but our work speaks for itself.  When we are not working with clients, we are implementing internal projects with the latest technology.  And no, we are not your average programmers.  We have social skills.

					<h1>The Culture</h1>
					<div class="body">
					We work hard and play hard.  We take quality work very seriously, but if working outside in flip-flops is what gets high quality results, then that is how we plan to do it.  We consider ourselves modern day magicians.  Magic is nothing if not fun.
